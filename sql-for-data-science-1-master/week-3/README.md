## Module introduction

[video](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-for-data-science/lecture/NDsRj/module-introduction)

Subqueries and joins are used to combine data from multiple tables.

### Joins

We'll learn about different types of joins:

- cartesian joins
- inner joins
- left and right joins
- full outer joins
- self joins

We'll also learn how to make queries cleaner and more efficient using aliases
and pre-qualifiers.

## Using subqueries

[video](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-for-data-science/lecture/FChaS/using-subqueries)

Using one table is useful, but a lot of value comes from using data from
multiple tables.

One of the ways to combine data from multiple tables is by using subqueries.

### What are subqueries?

Subqueries are queries embedded in other queries.

Relational databases store data in multiple tables. Subqueries merge data from
multiple sources together.

Subqueries are useful for adding additional filtering criteria.

### Problem: Get regions for customers who have ordered freight >= 100

With our currently limited knowledge of single table queries we would have to:

1. retrieve customer IDs for orders with freight over 100 from the `orders`
   table
2. retrieve customer details from the `customers` table
3. combine the two queries

e.g.

```sql
-- get customer ids
SELECT customer_id
FROM orders
WHERE freight >= 100;

-- get regions
SELECT customer_id, company_name, region
FROM customers
WHERE customer_id in (1,2,3,...);
```

#### Combined with a subquery

```sql
SELECT customer_id, comppany_name, region
FROM customers
WHERE customer_id IN (
  SELECT customer_id
  FROM orders
  WHERE freight >= 100
);
```

### Working with subquery statements

With subqueries, SQL will be performing two operations. The subquery is always
performed first.

When troubleshooting, always evaluate the innermost query first, as that is what
SQL will be evaluating first.

## Subquery Best Practices and Considerations

[video](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-for-data-science/lecture/3ubfD/subquery-best-practices-and-considerations)

- there is no limit to the depth subqueries one can use
- the more subqueries one uses, the more performance is impacted
- subquery `SELECT`s can only retrieve data for a single column at a time

### Subquery in a Subquery

1. get the order numbers for toothbrushes
2. get the customer ids for those orders
3. get the customer information for those orders

```sql
SELECT customer_name, customer_contact
FROM customers
WHERE customer_id IN (
  SELECT customer_id
  FROM orders
  WHERE order_number IN (
    SELECT order_number
    FROM order_items
    WHERE product_name = 'Toothbrush'
  )
)
```

[poorsql.com](http://poorsql.com) can be used to better format poorly formatted
SQL.

### Subqueries for calculations

Get the total number of orders for each customer:

```sql
SELECT
  customer_name
  ,customer_state
  (
    SELECT COUNT (*) AS total_orders
    FROM Orders
    WHERE Orders.customer_id = Customers.customer_id
  ) AS orders
FROM Customers
ORDER BY customer_name
```

Instead of using a subquery in a `WHERE` statement, we can use it inside a
`SELECT` statement.

### The power of subqueries

Although powerful, subqueries can have a performance impact. It' important to
evaluate other options for selecting data from multiple tables. Joins are often
more performant to use than subqueries.

## Joining Tables: An Introduction

### Benefits of breaking data into tables

- efficient storage
- easier manipulation
- greater scalability
- logically models a process
- tables are related through commong values (primary and foreign keys)

### Joins

Joins associate correct records from each table on the fly.

They allow for data retrieval from multiple tables in one query.

Joins are not _physical_ - they persist for the duration of the query execution.

## Cartesian (Cross) Joins

Like a cartesian product, each row in the first table joins with all the rows of
another table.

If a table 1 has 10 rows, and table 2 has 10 rows, then the result will have 100
rows. The result is always a new table of `NxM` rows.

As a result of the size of the new table, and computational cost, they are
infrequently used, but they are still valuable in certain situations. A deck of
cards can be created by creating a cartesian product of all face card types, and
the possible values each card can have.

### Cartesian / Cross Join Example

```sql
SELECT
  product_name
  ,unit_price
  ,company_name
FROM suppliers CROSS JOIN products;
```

### Different ways to create cartesian joins

If `LEFT JOIN` and `INNER JOIN` are used with `ON` or `USING`, SQLite will join
tables using a cartesian join strategy:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM A JOIN B;

SELECT *
FROM A
INNER JOIN B;

SELECT *
FROM A
CROSS JOIN B;

SELECT *
FROM A, B;
```

### Takeaways

Cross / cartesian joins:

- are not frequently used
- are computationally taxing
- will
